# Flashcards Example

With **Flashcards** and **Spaced Repetition** you can learn effectively. MindGraph generates questions from your notes.

## How to Create Flashcards

1. Enable Flashcards in **Settings > Integrations**
2. Right-click a note > **Start Quiz**
3. AI automatically creates questions
4. Save good questions as flashcards

## Spaced Repetition

The SM-2 algorithm ensures you review cards right when you'd otherwise forget them:

- **Again** - Show card again tomorrow
- **Hard** - Short interval
- **Good** - Normal interval
- **Easy** - Long interval

## Tips

- Keep cards **short and precise**
- One question per card
- Study regularly, not all at once
- Use your own words instead of copy-paste
