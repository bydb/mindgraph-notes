# Welcome to MindGraph Notes!

Great to have you here. MindGraph Notes is your personal space for notes, ideas, and exam preparation — everything on your computer, no cloud, no account needed.

This note will walk you through the key features step by step. Just keep scrolling.

---

## 1. The Editor

You're looking at the **Editor** right now. You write in Markdown on the left, and the formatted preview appears on the right.

Here's how Markdown works:
- `**bold**` becomes **bold**, `*italic*` becomes *italic*
- Headings start with `#`, `##`, `###`
- Lists with `-` or `1.`
- Tables, LaTeX formulas, and diagrams are also supported

> **Try it:** Click "Editor" at the top and start typing. You'll see the formatted preview right away.

## 2. Linking Notes

What makes MindGraph special: You can **link notes** together — like Wikipedia, but for your own knowledge.

Type `[[` and pick a note. For example: [[Canvas Example]]

**Why is this useful?**
- Your knowledge becomes connected instead of hidden in folders
- You'll discover connections between lectures and topics
- **Backlinks** automatically show which notes link here

> **Tip:** Link related topics while taking notes — that's how you build your personal knowledge network.

---

## 3. Canvas — Your Knowledge Graph

The **Canvas** displays your linked notes as an interactive graph. See how your knowledge connects at a glance.

How to open the Canvas:
1. Click **Canvas** in the tab bar at the top
2. Or right-click a note → "Open in Canvas"

You can move notes around, expand connections, and discover new links. More in the [[Canvas Example|Canvas example note]].

## 4. Flashcards & Exam Preparation

MindGraph can generate **flashcards** from your notes — perfect for exam prep.

Here's how:
1. Right-click on a note or folder
2. → "Generate Quiz" (requires Ollama — a free, local AI)
3. Questions are saved as flashcards
4. **Spaced Repetition** automatically schedules when you should review each card

You can also import existing flashcards from **Anki** (.apkg).

More in the [[Flashcards Example|Flashcards example note]].

## 5. Templates

Instead of starting every note from scratch, you can use **templates**. MindGraph comes with templates for:
- **Daily Note** — with date, tasks, and reflection
- **Zettel** — for Zettelkasten notes with ID and references
- **Meeting** — with agenda, participants, and action items

How to use a template:
1. Press `Cmd+Shift+T` (Template Picker)
2. Choose a template
3. Your note is created with a pre-filled structure

> **Tip:** Under Settings → Templates you can create your own templates and customize the built-in ones.

## 6. Essential Shortcuts

| Shortcut | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `Cmd+N` | Create a new note |
| `Cmd+Shift+T` | Pick a template (Template Picker) |
| `Cmd+K` | Quick search — open a note |
| `Cmd+E` | Cycle editor mode (Edit → Live Preview → Preview) |
| `Cmd+,` | Open settings |
| `Cmd+B` | **Bold** |

---

## What's Next?

- **Create your first note** with `Cmd+N`
- Check out the [[Canvas Example|Examples]] in the folder on the left
- Set up a local AI under `Cmd+,` → Integrations (Ollama) to generate quiz questions

All your notes are simple Markdown files in the folder you just chose. You can open them with any other app too. No lock-in, no subscription — your data belongs to you.

Happy learning!
